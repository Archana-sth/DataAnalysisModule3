-- Q1) Join products to categories: list product_name, category_name, price.

select
	p.name as product_name,
    c.name as category_name,
    p.price
from products as p
inner join categories as c
on p.category_id= c.category_id;


-- Q2) For each order item, show: order_id, order_datetime, store_name,
--     product_name, quantity, line_total (= quantity * products.price).
--     Sort by order_datetime, then order_id.
select
	o.order_id,
    o.order_datetime,
    s.name as store_name,
    p.name as product_name,
    oi.quantity as product_quantity,
    (oi.quantity * p.price) as line_total
from orders as o
inner join stores as s
	on o.store_id = s.store_id
inner join order_items as oi
	on o.order_id = oi.order_id
inner join products as p
	on oi.product_id = p.product_id
order by o.order_datetime, o.order_id; 
  
    

-- Q3) Customer order history (PAID only):
--     For each order, show customer_name, store_name, order_datetime,
--     order_total (= SUM(quantity * products.price) per order).
select
	concat(c. first_name, " ", c.last_name) as customer_name,
    s.name as store_name,
    o.order_datetime,
    sum(oi.quantity * p.price) as order_total
from customers c
join orders o 
	on c.customer_id = o.customer_id
join stores s 
	on s.store_id = o.store_id
join order_items oi
	on oi.order_id = o.order_id
join products p
	on p.product_id = oi.product_id
where o.status = 'paid'
group by c.first_name, c.last_name, s.name, o.order_datetime
;
-- Q4) Left join to find customers who have never placed an order.
--     Return first_name, last_name, city, state.
select 
	c.first_name,
    c.Last_name,
    c.city,
    c.state
from customers c
left join orders o
	on c.customer_id = o.customer_id
where o.customer_id is null;


-- Q5) For each store, list the top-selling product by units (PAID only).
--     Return store_name, product_name, total_units.
--     Hint: Use a window function (ROW_NUMBER PARTITION BY store) or a correlated subquery.



-- Q6) Inventory check: show rows where on_hand < 12 in any store.
--     Return store_name, product_name, on_hand.
select 
	s.name as store_name,
    p.name as product_name,
    i.on_hand 
from stores s
join inventory i
	on s.store_id = i.store_id
join products p
	on p.product_id = i.product_id
where on_hand < 12;
    
    

-- Q7) Manager roster: list each store's manager_name and hire_date.
--     (Assume title = 'Manager').
select
	concat(first_name, " ", last_name) as manager_name,
    hire_date
from employees
where title = 'manager';

-- Q8) Using a subquery/CTE: list products whose total PAID revenue is above
--     the average PAID product revenue. Return product_name, total_revenue.

-- Q9) Churn-ish check: list customers with their last PAID order date.
--     If they have no PAID orders, show NULL.
--     Hint: Put the status filter in the LEFT JOIN's ON clause to preserve non-buyer rows.

-- Q10) Product mix report (PAID only):
--     For each store and category, show total units and total revenue (= SUM(quantity * products.price)).
