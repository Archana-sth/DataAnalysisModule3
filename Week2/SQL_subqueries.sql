-- =========================================================
-- SUBQUERIES & NESTED LOGIC PRACTICE
-- =========================================================

-- Q1) Scalar subquery (AVG benchmark):
--     List products priced above the overall average product price.
--     Return product_id, name, price.

select product_id, name, price
from products
where price > (
select avg(price)
from products);

-- Q2) Scalar subquery (MAX within category):
--     Find the most expensive product(s) in the 'Beans' category.
--     (Return all ties if more than one product shares the max price.)
--     Return product_id, name, price.

select product_id, name, price
from products
where price = (
	select max(price)
	from products
	where name = 'Beans'
	);

-- Q3) List subquery (IN with nested lookup):
--     List customers who have purchased at least one product in the 'Merch' category.
--     Return customer_id, first_name, last_name.
--     Hint: Use a subquery to find the category_id for 'Merch', then a subquery to find product_ids.
select customer_id, first_name, last_name
from customers
where customer_id in (
	select customer_id
	from orders
    where order_id in (
		select order_id
		from order_items
        where product_id in (
			select product_id
            from products
            where category_id =(
				select category_id
				from categories
				where name = 'Merch'
            )
		)
	)
);


-- Q4) List subquery (NOT IN / anti-join logic):
--     List products that have never been ordered (their product_id never appears in order_items).
--     Return product_id, name, price.

select product_id, name, price
from products
where product_id not in(
	select product_id
    from order_items
    );

-- Q5) Table subquery (derived table + compare to overall average):
--     Build a derived table that computes total_units_sold per product
--     (SUM(order_items.quantity) grouped by product_id).
--     Then return only products whose total_units_sold is greater than the
--     average total_units_sold across all products.
--     Return product_id, product_name, total_units_sold.

select 
	dt.product_id, 
	p.name as product_name,
	dt.total_units_sold
 from(
	select 
		product_id,
		sum(quantity) as total_units_sold
		from order_items
		group by product_id
	)dt
join products p
	on p.product_id= dt.product_id
where dt.total_units_sold > (
	select avg(total_units_sold)
    from (
		select sum(quantity) as total_units_sold
        from order_items
        group by product_id
        ) avg_dt
);
